# Project Description

AGMEETING is a software application designed to supplement and streamline company meetings by providing a framework for interaction 
structured on the principles of Robertâ€™s Rules of Order. Participants in the meeting will be guided by the Moderator through an interactive 
agenda within the application and will be able to take actions and vote on the agenda items. The application also allows for Moderators 
to upload files which are attached to agenda items. The software can be used for any type of meeting and runs on any device with web 
browsing capabilities. The goal of this application is to ensure that companies have efficient and productive meetings while maintaining 
the type of positive brainstorming and communication that a normal meeting would provide.
