# User Groups

### Mid to Large Scale Companies
* This user group is the main focus when developing the software as they are the most likely to use it in its fullest capacity. 
  This user group is the most likely to have multiple offices and employees working in different areas which could benefit from the use of the software. 
  This user group is also the most likely to need Robertâ€™s Rules of order to ensure efficient meeting communication. 
  
* Example Scenario:
* The company has an Annual General meeting upcoming and has registered for the software. They have had trouble with order in meetings in the past and 
  are excited to try this software. A moderator has been appointed and as the meeting starts the participants are greeted with a welcome message from the moderator. 
  The participants move through the agenda items and are able to vote and make points on the items in the meeting. At the end of the meeting, all of the employees 
  are impressed about how well the software coordinates communication.
