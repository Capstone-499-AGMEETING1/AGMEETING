# User Groups

### Mid to Large Scale Companies
* This user group is the main focus when developing the software as they are the most likely to use it in its fullest capacity. 
  This user group is the most likely to have multiple offices and employees working in different areas which could benefit from the use of the software. 
  This user group is also the most likely to need Robertâ€™s Rules of order to ensure efficient meeting communication. 
  
* Example Scenario:
  - The company has an Annual General meeting upcoming and has registered for the software. They have had trouble with order in meetings in the past and 
    are excited to try this software. A moderator has been appointed and as the meeting starts the participants are greeted with a welcome message from the moderator. 
    The participants move through the agenda items and are able to vote and make points on the items in the meeting. At the end of the meeting, all of the employees 
    are impressed about how well the software coordinates communication.
    
 ### Smaller Companies and Startups
 * This user group will likely have less members in meetings and most likely have moderators and administrators acting as participants. The user group will also benefit    from users being able to connect remotely as smaller companies may have members networking in different areas or working remotely. The interactive agenda will be very    helpful for this user group as they will be able to receive updates from remote members through the meeting software.

 * Example Scenario:
   - A small start up has been using the software to coordinate with a few of their members who are working remotely. They have one person who is both the admin and          moderator and mostly use the software to make big decisions about the direction of their company. Since these decisions usually come with a lot of stress the            software helps to maintain a calm environment for the company to communicate ideas efficiently.
