### Goal of the application:

- AGMeeting is a meeting application designed to simplify the process of company meetings. There are 3 different possible users of the software at any given time: Participant, Moderator, and Administrator. One of the main functionalitities of the software is to facilitate efficient communication during meetings through the use of an interactive agenda. The Vault page allows participants to easily access any documents that the Moderator or administrator wishes to share with participants. The moderator sets up the meeting structure by adding items to the agenda and then the participants use this agenda to vote or discuss various items or proposals. The target user group for this software would be mid to large scale companies that have meetings frequently, as well as companies that have employees traveling that can participate remotely.
