### Goal of the application:

- AGMeeting is a meeting application designed to simplify the process of company meetings. There are 3 different
  possible users of the software at any given time: Participant, Moderator, and Administrator. One of the main
  functionalities of the software is to facilitate efficient communication during meetings through the use of an
  interactive agenda. The Vault page allows participants to easily access any documents that the Moderator or
  administrator wishes to share with participants. The moderator sets up the meeting structure by adding items to the
  agenda and then the participants use this agenda to vote or discuss various items or proposals. The target user group
  for this software would be mid to large scale companies that have meetings frequently, as well as companies that have
  employees traveling that can participate remotely.

### Peer Testing 2 Notes

- Visually very pleasing and clear
- UI is easy to follow. Alert system attracts attention and the login and registration popups are appreciated. simple,
  intuitive, resembles other design practices
- UI design is very well made and visually appealing. Buttons and features are placed intuitively.
- Login page is very consistent with other applications.
- It's got a very pleasing design and is quite consistent. The functions that are implemented so far work as expected.
- UI follows convention, looks clean.
- layout most minus agenda new button. colors are snappy.
- There were like 3 settings buttons all with the same icon which is a tad confusing but overall no complaints
- Could use a pi chart in the agenda voting screen.
- coloring - purple on blue. location of the add button on the agenda page. certain names such as "vault" were unclear.
- I advise revamping the interactions menu. Perhaps break some of them up and add more buttons to the side bar,
  particularly the voting system
- Clicking the "check all" button on the list doesn't select all items in the menu
- Either more intuitive ways of accomplishing tasks or documentation/manual
- some of the element names can be confusing to someone using the page for the first time (item/session). The function
  of the interactions button is not immediately clear
- all icons need to be changed to represent the actual function. new agenda button RTL needs to be removed. you arent
  supporting laguages that need RTL so it can go.
