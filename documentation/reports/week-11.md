# Week 11 Team Report

This week we spent time working on registered/logged-in users page, the content message page, the general settings page,
and the roll call page. We also worked on creating the Google form for peer-testing. We have a general idea of what we
need to show for peer testing, we can expand this after our meeting with the professor on Friday.
