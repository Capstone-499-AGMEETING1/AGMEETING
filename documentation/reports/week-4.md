# Week 4 Team Report

This week we mainly focused on documentation and learning about how to use the software.

### Carson

- AGMeeting has 3 roles, moderator (leads discussion), administrator (watching numbers), and participant (providing
  feedback and decisions).
- In Session page displays the minutes of the meeting.
- Two interactions, those initiated by the moderator, and those available to participants at any time (Any-Time Buttons).
- The administrator can also be the moderator but this is not recommended.
- There is a roll call feature that allows you to see who is supposed to attend the meeting, and who is currently logged
  in.

### Chester

- System can be chosen for use towards AGMs, Committee Meetings or Brainstorming according to user.
- Must log off when not in use as it can potentially affect those still participating (Any-Time votes).
- At any time within the app, the user can switch between "In Session", "Agenda", "Vault" and "Interaction", although the latter is only available when a moderator has indiciated it is ready to use and requires some sort of action by participants.
- The administrator/moderator has access to the "Admin" button which allows management of participants in the meeting.
- There is a "Content and Messages" feature that displays a pop-up message to targeted logged-in users.

### Garry

- Must be provided a log-in email address and password from the meeting administrator in order to participate.
- The Agenda page displays the plan for the meeting set by the moderator.
- Vault function enables participants to readily access any documents shared by the moderator or administrator.
- Administrators ensure the meeting is setup properly and oversees issues with participants, but are unable to participate unless they login under a different account.
- Administrators are able to adjust many general features, such as Event Name, Number of Comments per User, and Time for the Voting Session.
