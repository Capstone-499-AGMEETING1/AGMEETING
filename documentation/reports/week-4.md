# Week 4 Team Report

This week we mainly focused on documentation and learning about how to use the software.

### Carson

- AGMeeting has 3 roles, moderator (leads discussion), administrator (watching numbers), and participant (providing
  feedback and decisions).
- In Session page displays the minutes of the meeting.
- Two interactions, those initiated by the moderator, and those available to participants at any time (Any-Time Buttons).
- The administrator can also be the moderator but this is not recommended.
- There is a roll call feature that allows you to see who is supposed to attend the meeting, and who is currently logged
  in.
