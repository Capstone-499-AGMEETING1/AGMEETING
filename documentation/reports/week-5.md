# Week 5 Team Report

This week we focused on finishing up reading the documentation, as well as working on our requirements
report/presentation.

### Carson

- A moderator cannot participate, if they wish to participate they must be logged in on two separate devices.
- Every time a comment is requested it will pop up on the moderator, as well as the admins screen.
- While a vote is ongoing only a moderator or admin can see the current percentage per option.
- When a meeting ends, there is a button to save the meeting log which exports the "In Session" log as a pdf.
- There is a light version of AGMEETING which allows the moderator to run the meeting without all the extra steps.
