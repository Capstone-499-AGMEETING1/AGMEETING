- It seemed that your requirements are well-developed, although as a group we were unsure what the current issues are
  with the backend. Will you be required to write the entire backend from scratch, or will you be modifying the existing
  backend to improve it? If the backend is being written from scratch what made you choose to go with PHP for the
  language?
- The testing was fairly straightforward and will ensure your code behaves as expected. The only section that we were
  unsure about is how you were going to implement integration for your testing. Were you planning on implementing
  continuous integration in GitLab/Digital Ocean?

- The presentation provided a very clear description of the target user groups, and how they will interact with the
  website. The presentation mentioned that both user groups can register/log in. Will there be any measures in place to
  ensure that only verified healers can register as healers on the website?
- The presentation presented all the technologies that will be used for the project. In terms of security, it was
  mentioned stripe would be used for payments. How does stripe handle security and ensures that a user’s payment details
  remain secure? How will the website ensure a patient’s health records remain secure? Is there anything you will need
  to implement to ensure that everything remains secure?

- The presentation was clear that the users will be able to request a booking. How are these bookings managed within the
  system? What will prevent other users from booking an appointment at the same time? Will this be handled by a human,
  or by software?
- The presentation very clearly stated the processes the team will follow for all aspects of testing. It mentioned the
  technologies that would be used for back-end testing. What framework/technologies will be used to test the front-end?
  Will you be automating the regression testing or will it be done manually?
