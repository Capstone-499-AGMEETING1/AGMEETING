### Cyclops

- The functional and non-functional requirements were presented in a clear and concise manner, the presentation did run
  long but was very informative. The user’s score was mentioned fairly often throughout the presentation, it was a
  little unclear how this score was calculated. Does the user calculate the score, and input it themselves? Is it
  calculated based on their responses to questions they answer?
- The presentation provided the pros and cons of multiple platforms very clearly. It made it easy to understand why the
  group chose to work with Ionic for this project. It was unclear if Ionic with Angular is the only technology needed
  for this project? Will you be using something for the backend/database? Are you only building the app itself and will
  be interacting with an existing backend?

### Cyclops (1)

- The visual of the eco-tracker was helpful and made the purpose of the mobile app much clearer. In terms of the
  eco-tracker, security is important when it comes to a user’s data. What data will need to be collected for the
  eco-tracker to work as expected? How will the software ensure security and protect the user’s data? What
  authentication will be used to protect it?
- It was interesting that Ruby on Rails provides options for easy unit testing of the group’s code. It was mentioned
  that code would need to be reviewed before being merged which greatly helps with preventing bugs, and other issues. It
  was not as clear what other forms of testing would be implemented in the project. Will continuous integration be
  implemented to ensure that new code does not break the main build? Will integration testing be implemented?

### Cyclops (2)

- The differences between the target user groups were presented clearly, it was very clear what users should be able to
  do, and what the administrators should be able to do. It was unclear what the difference is between individual users
  and organizations, this was mentioned as two categories of the user group but was not elaborated upon. How do these
  two groups differ in terms of what they are able to do in the app?
- The different types of testing were clearly explained in the presentation, automated testing was mentioned and the
  different types were explained. The group mentioned that continuous integration would be used. It was not clear what
  types of automated testing the group is planning on using in the project, or if they plan on using multiple types. How
  will continuous integration be implemented to ensure the code works as expected before merging in new features?
