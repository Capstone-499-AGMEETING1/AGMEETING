- The functional and non-functional requirements were presented in a clear and concise manner, the presentation did run
  long but was very informative. The userâ€™s score was mentioned fairly often throughout the presentation, it was a
  little unclear how this score was calculated. Does the user calculate the score, and input it themselves? Is it
  calculated based on their responses to questions they answer?
- The presentation provided the pros and cons of multiple platforms very clearly. It made it easy to understand why the
  group chose to work with Ionic for this project. It was unclear if Ionic with Angular is the only technology needed
  for this project? Will you be using something for the backend/database? Are you only building the app itself and will
  be interacting with an existing backend?
