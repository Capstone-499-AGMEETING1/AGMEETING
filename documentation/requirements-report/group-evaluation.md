# Requirement Report Group Evaluations

All members of the team contributed to each of the group evaluations.

### Laboratory Information Management System

### Laboratory Information Management System (1)

### AGMEETING

### AGMEETING (2)

### CHECKLICK

- Good use of integrating a demonstration of the Checklick application within the video. How do you plan to fulfill your goals of improving the UI? How do you plan on gathering feedback data as well?
- The audio for the presentation needs balancing as certain members are too loud or quiet. It's mentioned that your other goals are to make it easier to maintain as well as improve performance. How do you plan on doing so? What do you plan on doing to improve upon these aspects?

### CHECKLICK (1)

- The description and user groups were presented clearly and was informative. It did run long and could be shortened in some areas such as with the functional and non-functional requirements. It is mentioned in the DFD Milestones that peer testing will occur. Who exactly is the target audience for the peer testing? How many people will participate? How will you compile and use this feedback data?
- Your goal is mentioned to be in improving the process and making the application more intuitive for the user. How do you plan on doing so? What are some of the features that you will be adding or modifying that are part of your scope? Do you have more concrete details on what will be part of the "revamp" apart from what is mentioned?

### CHECKLICK (2)

- The video was quite informative and everything was presented in a clear manner. The DFD however, was missing from the presentation. How does information flow through the system? How is it stored or processed along the way? What does the level 0 and level 1 DFD look like?
- There are extensive plans on the redesigning and restyling of the application website. Are there any plans on incorporating client or user feedback on the features of the project during the development phase?

### Cyclops

- The functional and non-functional requirements were presented in a clear and concise manner, the presentation did run
  long but was very informative. The user’s score was mentioned fairly often throughout the presentation, it was a
  little unclear how this score was calculated. Does the user calculate the score, and input it themselves? Is it
  calculated based on their responses to questions they answer?
- The presentation provided the pros and cons of multiple platforms very clearly. It made it easy to understand why the
  group chose to work with Ionic for this project. It was unclear if Ionic with Angular is the only technology needed
  for this project? Will you be using something for the backend/database? Are you only building the app itself and will
  be interacting with an existing backend?

### Cyclops (1)

- The visual of the eco-tracker was helpful and made the purpose of the mobile app much clearer. In terms of the
  eco-tracker, security is important when it comes to a user’s data. What data will need to be collected for the
  eco-tracker to work as expected? How will the software ensure security and protect the user’s data? What
  authentication will be used to protect it?
- It was interesting that Ruby on Rails provides options for easy unit testing of the group’s code. It was mentioned
  that code would need to be reviewed before being merged which greatly helps with preventing bugs, and other issues. It
  was not as clear what other forms of testing would be implemented in the project. Will continuous integration be
  implemented to ensure that new code does not break the main build? Will integration testing be implemented?

### Cyclops (2)

- The differences between the target user groups were presented clearly, it was very clear what users should be able to
  do, and what the administrators should be able to do. It was unclear what the difference is between individual users
  and organizations, this was mentioned as two categories of the user group but was not elaborated upon. How do these
  two groups differ in terms of what they are able to do in the app?
- The different types of testing were clearly explained in the presentation, automated testing was mentioned and the
  different types were explained. The group mentioned that continuous integration would be used. It was not clear what
  types of automated testing the group is planning on using in the project, or if they plan on using multiple types. How
  will continuous integration be implemented to ensure the code works as expected before merging in new features?

### Ethics Dashboard

### Ethics Dashboard (2)

### Medical Image Matching

### Medical Image Matching (1)

### Medical Image De-Identification

-There seems to be a bit confusion with the level 0 and level 1 DFDs. The server and DICOM files are located differently within the process. How does the application and its processes individually interact with external entities such as the database and file system? How does the data flow through the Orthanc server?
-The milestones for the project are fleshed out and well thought. It is mentioned that your aim is to complete all functional requirements. The only one right now is the de-identification and anonymizing aspect of the application. Are there more details on these requirements? How does the app have to behave and what functions should be implemented in order to meet this criteria?

### Medical Image De-Identification (1)

-The current process and problem is well explained within the video presentation. Regarding your tech stack, you have detailed the pros and cons of the two programming languages. What build tools or libraries will you be utilizing to progress with your development?
- You have outlined the testing methods you will be using for the project, although it is not clear how exactly you will be performing these tests and how the code will be maintained in the future. What kind of testing environment will you be using for these tests? How will you assure that there is quality assurance? Will the application be easy to maintain and how so?

### Medical Image De-Identification (2)

- The presentation is well presented and easy to read, although it is unclear what your requirements are. What are your functional requirements as well as the non-functional requirements for your project?
- Testing strategies are also mentioned with your project presentation. Although it is present and thought out, what are your plans and goals for meeting quality assurance? What do you need to achieve in order to meet quality assurance requirements?

### woo woo network

- It seemed that your requirements are well-developed, although as a group we were unsure what the current issues are
  with the backend. Will you be required to write the entire backend from scratch, or will you be modifying the existing
  backend to improve it? If the backend is being written from scratch what made you choose to go with PHP for the
  language?
- The testing was fairly straightforward and will ensure your code behaves as expected. The only section that we were
  unsure about is how you were going to implement integration for your testing. Were you planning on implementing
  continuous integration in GitLab/Digital Ocean?

### woo woo network (1)

- The presentation provided a very clear description of the target user groups, and how they will interact with the
  website. The presentation mentioned that both user groups can register/log in. Will there be any measures in place to
  ensure that only verified healers can register as healers on the website?
- The presentation presented all the technologies that will be used for the project. In terms of security, it was
  mentioned stripe would be used for payments. How does stripe handle security and ensures that a user’s payment details
  remain secure? How will the website ensure a patient’s health records remain secure? Is there anything you will need
  to implement to ensure that everything remains secure?

### woo woo network (2)

- The presentation was clear that the users will be able to request a booking. How are these bookings managed within the
  system? What will prevent other users from booking an appointment at the same time? Will this be handled by a human,
  or by software?
- The presentation very clearly stated the processes the team will follow for all aspects of testing. It mentioned the
  technologies that would be used for back-end testing. What framework/technologies will be used to test the front-end?
  Will you be automating the regression testing or will it be done manually?
